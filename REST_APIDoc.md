# FreeTAKServer REST API Documentation
the FreeTAKServer REST API is a human readeble approach to the TAK world. the API  allows you to connect easily third parties to the TAK family, without the need to understand the complexity of the COT structure or what a TCP connection is.  

## List of supported API
In the current release (1.2), FTS supports following API:
  * ManageGeoEvent
  * ManageChat
  * ManageEmergency
  * ManagePresence
  
## General Configuration
> To quickly test the APi you can use a browser extension (Chrome) like ARC Advanced rest client.REST APIs are easy to use, however they require a minimum ammount of knowledge, we DO NOT provide support to explain WHAT an API is. Please refer to an online tutorial such as [this](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/using-http-apis-for-iot-beginners-guide/). 

### end Point
the APi uses the following format

VERB [Protocol]://IP:PORT/APIName/action

for example
```
POST http://104.58.20.216:9999/manageGeoObject/postGeoObject
```

### Authorization
 to use the API you need to have  a rest key .
the authorization is placed in the header of the message.
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY]

> you need to use the string 'Bearer' before your API KEY

a valid key is generated from FTS' [CLI](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/blob/main/docs/docs/CLI.md) or, since 1.4 also from the Web UI, and stored into the DB. 
to add an API user in the CLI type  
```
add_api_user
```
see CLI help for details.
To create a API TOKEN using the Web UI, go the User section.

to consume the API you need to request a key to your FTS admin. 

the following is a key non working example
```
{“Authorization”: “Bearer meg@secre7apip@guesmeIfyouCan”}
```

### Message
the message is placed in the body of the request as JSON formatted. See below for detailed examples.
